# Android Developer Interview Studyguide
This is a general study guide for things you may be asked about in Android Dev interviews. These are based off questions I've been asked over multiple 
Android Dev job interviews. I also included some basics that you'll need to be familiar with, just in case. Feel free to expand on the list.
